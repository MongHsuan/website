	<p class="title"><i>None of us had period then.</i> (2020)</p>
<p class="titleinfo" style="width:60%">This series is based on the story of Lion’s Plaza, which is known for its haunted stories and suppressed history. It is said that many people fall ill as soon as they enter the building. Located in the heart of Taipei, an area of youth culture and tourists, Lion’s Plaza was one of the most promising urban projects built in the 70s. While just within few years of its grand opening, numerous fires, suicides, gun-shots had made the building a notorious crime hub. Rising on the site of previous Taiwan Garrison Command, where had imprisoned and executed innocent citizens under political accusations, Lion’s Plaza bears the covered brutal history of authoritarian enacted by the political party “Kuomintang” (KMT).
<br>
After WWII, KMT was soon defeated by the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the small island Taiwan from mainland China. With accumulated anger of injustice brought by the KMT, outraged Taiwanese started a protest after a policeman shot an old lady dead on the street. The protest led to a bloody massacre by military force of KMT, between 5,000 and 28,000 people were killed in one day, followed by an imposed martial law lasted for 38 years, which is the second longest in human history after Syria. During this period of time, around 140,000 people were imprisoned and about 4,000 were executed under the accusation of being against the government. The dictator, Chiang Kai-Shek, said he would rather have killed a hundred innocent people not to risk missing one protagonist. This part of history remains a taboo in public even until today and the KMT still wins 1/3 seats in the recent election in 2020.
<br>
“None of us had period then” names after six innocent women who were confined in Taiwan Garrison Command, where Lion’s Plaza locates. While one was sentenced, the five survived mention that no women had period coming when in captivity, which indicates their terrible physical and mental condition in confinement.</p>

<p class="workinfo" style="font-weight:500"><i>
We are not even aware of ourselves biting our lips, rubbing our feet under the chair, and being under water. None of us had period then in Lion’s Plaza. As a trade-off, 12 years later when we say “lights off!” The lights go off. Being frightened, we all stay quiet and look away from each other. Even though we understand that a profile is not a person, a mask won’t cover the conspiracy and an insecure security secures our imagination and properties.
<br><br>
What is after me is not a spy. That island used to be a wonderland of butterflies. Because we remember the route to the Grounds, by tracing the smell of human residues. These memories are later transformed into genetic codes, an inherited sense of the whole species. Human's exploitation, you said. Sitting on the trees we watch our flashbacks replay around the globe.
<br><br>
When it rains, it pours. The leakage has formed a lake of boiling hot soybean milk, so we decide to sell it to make a living. Our all time favourite “The river of frozen blood” is now available in the store again. According to the blacklist on my hand, you will get an unprecedented-crisis-limited edition delivered straight to your door without contact. Yes technically we always stay seamlessly connected by the map which says there’s no light in the end of the tunnel.
