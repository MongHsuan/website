<p class="title"><i>Pure Chance had brought them together.</i> (2016) </p>
<p class="titleinfo">digital c-print from film photograph and <i>Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</i> from Haruki Murakami.</p>

<p class="workinfo">One photograph is placed on the spine of the book without adhesive. The book forms a reverse V-shape to support the photograph on top. The photograph and the book are positioned at the edge of a plinth, in a dangerous balance, and in the triangle corner of the space. V formation is the way migratory birds fly together, in order to save energy for each other on the long and tiring trip. The Murakami's book is about how a group of friends experience an extreme sense of together-ness and how it fell apart.</p>
